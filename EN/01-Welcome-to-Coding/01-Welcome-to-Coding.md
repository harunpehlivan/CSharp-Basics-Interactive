# Welcome to Coding

Writing programming code (known as **coding** or **programming**) means to give instructions (commands) to tell the computer what to do. **Commands** are given in certain **programming language** such as C# or Python.

Sample **C# command**:
```cs
Console.WriteLine("I am coding");
```

Run the above command using the [**Run**] button. Modify it, play with it.

# The C# Language

**C#** is modern, powerful, general-purpose **programming language**, easy to learn, easy to read, easy to maintain, good choice for beginners. It combines procedural, object-oriented and functional programming styles, which we shall learn over the time.

C# is used for **Web** development, writing **mobile** apps, implementing server-side (back-end) logic and in many other scenarios.

In this training we shall use **the C# language** to learn coding. We shall learn new concepts using **C# code examples**. We shall write a lot of C# programs and shall solve many **practical exercises** in C#.

To use **C#** you either write your code in the code boxes in this training environment, or you install a development environment (**IDE**) like [**Visual Studio**](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com). We shall learn about Visual Studio later in this training.

Now, to simplify your first steps in coding, it is recommended to **write your code in the code boxes** in this training environment.

Now it is time to **start coding using the C# language**. We shall write single commands and programs, consisting of command sequences in C#.
